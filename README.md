Sample problems I found interesting from "An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms" by Melanie Mitchell. These are mostly sourced from the *Computer Exercises* section at the end of each chapter.

## Chapter 1, Question 2
Implement a simple GA with fitness-proportionate selection (_number of times an individual is expected to reproduce equals individual fitness/population fitness_), roulette-wheel sampling (_roulette wheel is spun N times, with each pair producing an offspring_), a population of 100, a single-point crossover rate of 0.7, and bitwise mutation rate of 0.001. Try this with a fitness function f(x) = the binary equivalent of x, where x is a chromosome of length 20.

Run this simple GA for 100 generations, plotting the peak fitness at each generation and the average population fitness at each generation. How do these plots change as you vary the population size, the crossover rate, and the mutation rate?

## Chapter 4, Question 1
Write a program to simulate a two-armed bandit with given mu1, mu2, var1, and var2. Test various strategies for allocating samples to the two arms, and determine which of the strategies tried maximizes the overall payoff. Use N > 1000 to avoid the effects of small sample sizes
